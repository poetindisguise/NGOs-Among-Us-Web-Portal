* As a component of the Software Engineering coursem we have built a web application where NGOs, Donors and Volunteers can register and carry out various operations.
* Used MERN stack for the development process.
* Agile methodologies of SCRUM were followed.
## Project Overview
Often, philanthropists desire to donate money, clothes, books etc. to NGOs in their city whom they can trust. Some people even want to volunteer to help the underprivileged for the well being of the society. However, due to lack of awareness, donors might not know about the existence and details of NGOs located near them. Also, many a time it is difficult for a person to contact somebody and ask whether any activity is going on at their organization for which they can volunteer. There is no central system wherein all the details of NGOs could be provided. <p>
Hence, we present to you our web portal “NGOs Among Us”, which makes an effort to bridge the gap between users and NGOs. The portal will provide the user with an option to register as a donor as well as volunteer. Furthemore, an NGO can enter its details and sign up with our portal too. The server helps the user by displaying a list of registered NGOs situated near him/her. <p>
The Volunteers will be able to know the schedule of the NGOs social work so that they can collaborate with the Organization. All the work done by the NGO can be seen by the donors registered who can either donate money or essential if they find the NGO trustworthy. Overall, the Portal will help both the people who want to donate as well as the NGOs who want to serve the society.<p>
